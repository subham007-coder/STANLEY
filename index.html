          <h2>Are you going to SPAM me?</h2>
          <p>
            We hate SPAM as much as you. However, our clients would like to send
            you special deals and offers via email, sms and phone. By
            participating you give your consent that they may do so. We believe
            this is not SPAM, but something our participants would actually like
            to receive. The frequency of these promotions are up to our clients.
            But you always have the option to opt-out by simply clicking on the
            opt-out links at the bottom of every email.
